**[xeokit](http://xeokit.io) News**

[<< back to xeokit.io](http://xeokit.io)

Since [xeolabs](http://xeolabs.com) created the [xeokit SDK](http://xeokit.io) on February 7, 2019, the SDK has been adopted by several AEC startups and industry
leaders who have integrated it into their Web applications and SaaS platforms. This has also resulted in partnerships
with companies who have sponsored the SDK's development, commissioned the development of custom plugins, and generously contributed back to the SDK's open source repositories.

=================================================================

[BIMData](http://bimdata.io), in Lyon, France, are upgrading their online BIM platform to use xeokit. Previously, BIMData
used [xeogl](http://xeogl.org), an earlier WebGL-based 3D library from xeolabs, but are now upgrading to xeokit to leverage
its superior performance and extensive plugins library.

xeolabs contracted with BIMData in 2017-2018 to develop their existing 3D BIM viewer, and are currently working with BIMData
to help them migrate it to xeokit.

xeolabs recently collaborated with [Toni Marti](https://github.com/tmarti), principle 3D engineer at UniZite, to develop an [open source plugin](https://xeokit.github.io/xeokit-sdk/docs/class/src/plugins/XKTLoaderPlugin/XKTLoaderPlugin.js~XKTLoaderPlugin.html) that
efficiently loads BIM models from an optimized binary format, along with a [CLI tool](https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-gltf-to-xkt)
to convert glTF models to the format. The format performs awesomely and was immediately adopted by xeokit users.

We look forward to collaborating on more xeokit capabilities as UniZite's product evolves.
