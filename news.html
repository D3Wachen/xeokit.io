[<< back to xeokit.io](http://xeokit.io)

Since [xeolabs](http://xeolabs.com) released the first beta version of the [xeokit SDK](http://xeokit.io) on February 7, 2019, the SDK has been adopted by several AEC startups and industry
leaders who have integrated it into their Web applications and SaaS platforms. This has also resulted in partnerships
with companies who have sponsored the SDK's development, commissioned the development of custom plugins, and generously contributed back to the SDK's open source repositories.
