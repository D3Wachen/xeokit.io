[<< back to xeokit.io](http://xeokit.io)

Since it's inception on February 7, 2019, the [xeokit SDK](http://xeokit.io) has been adopted by several AEC industry
leaders who have integrated it into their Web-based applications and SaaS platforms. We've also entered into exciting
partnerships with some of these users, some of whom have sponsored the SDK's development and contributed valuable features
back to its open source repository.

efficiently loads BIM models from an optimized binary format, along with a [CLI tool](https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-gltf-to-xkt)
to convert glTF models to the format. The format performs awesomely and was immediately adopted by xeokit users.

We look forward to collaborating on more xeokit capabilities as UniZite's product evolves.
