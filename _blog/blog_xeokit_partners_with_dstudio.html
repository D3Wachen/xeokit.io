                solutions and services to everyone involved in construction, urban and infrastructure projects.</p>

            <p>D-Studio is now a xeokit licensee, and xeokit has partnered with D-Studio to help develop a suite of
                browser-based 4D BIM applications that use the xeokit SDK for model visualization.</p>

            <p>Within our partnership, D-Studio have already sponsored a number of valuable xeokit features, including <a
                    href="https://xeokit.github.io/xeokit-sdk/docs/class/src/viewer/scene/postfx/SAO.js~SAO.html">Scalable
                Ambient Occlusion</a>, which enhances details by darkening the crevices in models (see screenshot above).</p>

            <p>D-Studio is helping to shape xeokit with real-world construction management expertise. This is a great example of the
                kind of win-win open source partnership that xeokit strives for.</p>
