            <h2>Why is my Model Jittering?</h2>

            <p>Sometimes, xeokit users would report that certain models would "jitter" as they moved. </p>

            <p>The screen capture below shows the problem, using a model of
                the <a href="https://www.peterson.fr/programme-neuf-23903.php">Marc Antoine</a> apartment complex in
                Saint-Denis, provided by <a href="https://bimdata.io">BIMData</a>. The IFC geometry for this model is in
                IFC
                global coordinates. Notice the way the model "shivers" as we rotate it.</p>

            <a href="https://xeokit.github.io/xeokit-sdk/examples/#loading_XKT_jitter_singlePrecision_MAP"> <img
                    src="./img/gifs/jitter.gif" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="..."></a><br>

                this example</a>]</p>

            <p>After some investigation, it turned out that:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p><b>The models had geometry that relied on double-precision values.</b> This was either because the
                    models were geographically
                    large with fine details, or because their geometries were positioned far from the origin of the IFC
                    global coordinate system
                    (BIMData's model happens to be positioned at <code>[1842022, 10, -5173301]</code>, which is
                    somewhere in Saint
                    Denis, France).</p>
                </li>

                <li><p><b>WebGL can only support single-precision values to ~7 decimal places of accuracy.</b> Using graphics APIs such
                    as
                    WebGL, OpenGL and
                    Direct3D, graphics processing units (GPUs) internally operate on single precision 32-bit
                    floating-point numbers. Therefore, the jittering turned out to be rounding error within WebGL
                    shaders, as each vertex position
                    continually snapped to its nearest available single-precision value.</p>
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p>So far, we've managed to avoid rounding jitter by using certain <a
                    href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-sdk/wiki/Creating-Files-for-Offline-BIM#42-ifcconvert-options-to-mitigate-precision-loss"><code>IfcConvert</code>
                options</a>, or
                <a href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-sdk/wiki/Creating-Files-for-Offline-BIM#431-a-python-script-using-ifcopenshell"><code>python
                    scripts on IfcOpenShell</code></a>, to "center"
                the geometries within our IFC models (see: <a
                        href="(https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-sdk/wiki/Creating-Files-for-Offline-BIM#42-ifcconvert-options-to-mitigate-precision-loss">Creating
                    Files for Offline BIM</a>). These workarounds work by transforming the geometries from IFC global
                coordinates to IFC local coordinates, which are (hopefully) small enough to be accurately represented by
                WebGL.</p>

            <p>The problem with these workarounds is that we lose the original global placement of our models. This
                means
                that we cannot
                load multiple models belonging to the same site and have them positioned correctly with respect to each
                other. Instead,
                they would all be in their local IFC coordinate system, and once loaded into xeokit, would be positioned
                right on top of
                each other.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, if the model is geographically huge, with fine details (eg. a 10km long roadworks that
                relies on 1cm
                accuracy), then
                centering doesn't help anyway, because the geometry will still have huge coordinate values.</p>

            <h2>Solution: Full-Precision Emulation</h2>

            <p>The solution was to extend <a href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-sdk"><code>xeokit-sdk</code></a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-gltf-to-xkt"><code>xeokit-gltf-to-xkt</code></a> with the
                ability to emulate full-precision geometry rendering on WebGL, as a robust way to eliminate rounding
                jitter with IFC models that contain
                large geometry coordinates.</p>

            <p>The screen capture below shows how this solution completely eliminates rounding jitter with BIMData's
                model,
                without needing to convert it to IFC local coordinates. Within xeokit's viewer, the model actually
                retains its full IFC global
                coordinate precision, and is still centered at <code>[1842022, 10, -5173301]</code> (the building's
                location in Saint Denis,
                France).</p>

            <a href="https://xeokit.github.io/xeokit-sdk/examples/#loading_XKT_jitter_fullPrecision_MAP"> <img
                    src="./img/gifs/no_jitter.gif" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="..."></a><br>
            <p class="text-center"><b>Figure 2. Full-Precision Emulation in xeokit</b><br>[<a
                    href="https://xeokit.github.io/xeokit-sdk/examples/#loading_XKT_jitter_fullPrecision_MAP">Run
                this example</a>]</p>

            <p>We can even load a second model, with IFC global coordinates centered at, say. <code>[-104567655, 10,
                231000000]</code>, and
                xeokit would happily have both of these models in the viewer, situated <code>259038312.73</code> units
                away from each other. </p>

            <p>Our jitter elimination uses a technique known as <b>relative-to-center (RTC) geometry coordinates</b>,
                which is used in flight simulators and geospatial visualization applications to accurately render very
                large models on single-precision GPUs. We won't describe the RTC technique here, but you can read all about it in the book <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/3D-Engine-Design-Virtual-Globes/dp/1568817118">3D Engine Design for
                Virtual Globes</a>, which was a valuable resource during the development of this release.</p>

            <h2>Upgrading your App to Full-Precision</h2>

            <p>We'll now describe how to upgrade your xeokit application to work with full-precision models. You
                can also
                find more information in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-sdk/pull/456">pull
                    request</a>
                for this update.</p>

            <h4>1. Update xeokit-gltf-to-xkt</h4>

            <p>First, update your version of <a
                    href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-gltf-to-xkt"><code>xeokit-gltf-to-xkt</code></a> to <code>0.5.0</code>
                or
                later, assuming
                that you're using that within your model conversion pipeline to convert glTF models to xeokit's
                optimized <code>.XKT</code> native geometry format.</p>

            <p>Then add the new <code>-f 6</code> option when you invoke <code>xeokit-gltf-to-xkt</code>'s <code>gltf2xkt</code>
                executable. This will cause the executable to output the new <code>.XKT 6</code> format, which preserves
                full model precision, using the RTC technique mentioned earlier.</p>

            <pre><code>
                $ ./gltf2xkt -f 6 -s scene.gltf -o scene.xkt
                </code></pre>

            <h4>2. Reconfigure IfcConvert</h4>

            <p>If you're using <code>IfcConvert</code> with option <code>--center-model</code>,
                <code>--site-local-placement</code> or <code>--building-local-placement</code>
                to center your models to avoid rounding jitter, then you can now remove that option.</p>

            <p>Likewise, if you're using <code>IfcOpenShell</code> scripts to center your models
                to avoid jitter, you can now remove those script invocations from your conversion pipeline.</p>

            <h4>3. Update xeokit-sdk</h4>

            <p>Lastly, update your version of <a
                    href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-sdk"><code>xeokit-sdk</code></a> to <code>1.4.8</code> or
                later. This version is
                a backwardly-compatible drop-in replacement for 1.4.7, which does not emulate full-precision.</p>

            <p>Now you can convert full-precision IFC models to <code>.xkt 6</code> and load them into your xeokit
                application, to accurately view them in the browser.</p>

            <h2>More Resources</h2>

            <p>As mentioned, <b><a href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-sdk/pull/456">pull request #456</a></b> has
                info on what code has been updated in <a
                        href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-sdk">xeokit-sdk 1.4.8</a>.</p>
            <p>For improved maintenance and QA, the converter logic in <a
                    href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-gltf-to-xkt"><code>xeokit-gltf-to-xkt</code></a>, used for
                generating <code>.XKT 6</code> format, has been
                factored out into its own library, <b><a href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-xkt-utils">
                    <code>xeokit-xkt-utils</code></a></b>. This allows us to more easily document and unit test the
                converter logic, and to more clearly use it as a reference implementation for developers wanting
                to build their own
                tools to generate <code>.XKT 6</code> format. Take a look at that library's repository for more
                insight into <code>.XKT 6</code> and RTC.</p>
