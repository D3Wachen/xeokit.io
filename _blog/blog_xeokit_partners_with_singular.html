            <p class="lead"><a href="https://www.snglr.com/en">Singular AG</a> in Zurich, Switzerland have chosen the xeokit SDK to power the
                graphics within their browser-based IFC model checking service.</p>

            <p>Xeokit has partnered with <a href="https://www.snglr.com/en">Singular</a> to provide dedicated support as they use the xeokit SDK to power the visualization component of their
                IFC model checking platform. The support package includes a customized training workshop to help Singular's developers
                get started quickly with the SDK.</p>

            <p>One of the reasons Singular chose xeokit was flexibility. Using the SDK, Singular is able
                to convert, store and visualize models on its own servers, rather than rely on
                cloud-based services. This allows things to be set up and tuned exactly the way Singular needs them to be.</p>

            <p>We're looking forward to a win-win partnership that will be great for both projects.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned!</p>
