            <p>Since October 2019, <a href="http://xeolabs.com">xeolabs</a> has been working with OpenProject GmbH
                to develop the IFC model viewer within OpenProject 10.4.</p>

            <p>The viewer is also available as a standalone BIM viewer, bundled as part of the xeokit SDK: <a href="https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-bim-viewer">https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-bim-viewer</a></p>

            <p>To use the viewer, download it from GitHub, or fork the repository, then drop in your own models, and you're good to go.</p>

            <p>It's a lot of fun working with the OpenProject team on this software. The development process was methodical and steady, using the OpenProject platform itself to coordinate tasks and keep things on target. We'll keep polishing this, and will continue to use the xeokit SDK to keep it on the cutting edge of browser-based BIM visualization.</p>
