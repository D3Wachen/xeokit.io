            <p>Through this partnership, xeolabs will provide bimspot with premium support and custom development
                services,
                while ensuring that the xeokit roadmap is prioritized and aligned to bimspot's requirements.</p>

            <p>bimspot will also support xeokit's development through sponsorship of open source features, and by

            <blockquote><p><b>We have been very impressed with the xeokit SDK's features.</b> Of particular note is
                xeokit's highly efficient binary .XKT model format, which makes loading and rendering large
                models faster than ever before. With the wide-ranging feature set offered by the SDK, we have
                been able to meet most of our product goals so far.</p>
                <p>Our developers have also spoken about their positive experience. They noted the active
                    development of the project and the quick and helpful responses from xeolabs whenever they had
                    any issues.</p>
